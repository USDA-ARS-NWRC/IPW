#  This include file for Makefile defines macros and rules for the
#  name and description files for IPW commands and library functions.
#
#  These macros control the behavior of this include file:
#
#	NAME	    = name of command or function
#	DESCRIPTION = one-line brief description of command or function
#	MAN_SECTION = the section where command's or function's man page
#			resides (1 or 3 respectively)
#	PATH_TO_MAN = the relative path from the HTML file with the list of
#			commands or functions to the associated man pages

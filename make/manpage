#  This Makefile defines macros and rules for IPW manpages.
#
#  This Makefile expects these macros to be defined:
#
#	NAME        = name of the IPW manpage (the file containing the
#		     source for the manpage is assumed to be NAME.man)
#	DESCRIPTION = one-line description for the man page
#	MANSECTION  = # of the section of the manual where the manpage goes

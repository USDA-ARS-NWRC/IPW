** NAME
**      _time_compact -- snowcover gravety, depth & temperature compaction
**
** SYNOPSIS
**      #include "_snobal.h"
**
**      void
**	_time_compact(void)
**
** DESCRIPTION
**	This routine replaces the original simple gravety compaction routine
**	which "aged" the snowcover by accounting for the compaction
**	or densification by gravity as time passes.  The original routine
**	relied on an approximation based on equations in Anderson (1976), which
**	increased the snowcover's density using the following "half-saturation"
**	function:
**
**		rho(time) = A / (1 + B/time)
**
**	Historically, precise snow density was not a concern, as long as mass
**	and SWE were correct.  With the development of the ASO program providing
**	time-series lidar snow depth images, and the 2017 snow season in the
*8	southern Sierra Nevada, with individual storms approaching 500mm of
**	deposition in a few days, and upper elevation snow depths of greater
**	than 10m, it became clear that a more robust density model was required.
**
**	Snow Density:  Snow density is initially a function of the temperature
**	of the ice particles (snow flakes) as they fall to the ground during a
**	storm.  Under very cold conditions (-10 to -15 C), we can get snow as
**	light as 50 kg m-3, which is really light powder and great skiing.
**	As the ice particle temperature approaches 0C, new snow densities can
**	be as high as 200 kg m-3, which is not light powder, but still pretty
**	good skiing, unless there is a lot of it. There are several (4)
**	processes that can increase snow density during and after the storm.
**	Note that the largest and most rapid changes occur during or just
**	following the storm.  Compaction (an increase in density without a
**	change in mass) can be caused by:
**	
**	1) Destructive mechanical metamorphism (compaction due to wind -
**	   affects mainly low density near-surface or new snow)
**	2) Destructive temperature metamorphism
**	3) Pressure - compaction due to snow load or overburden (affects both
**	   new snow deposition, snow on the ground, including drifting)
**	4) Addition of liquid water due to melt or rain
**
**	Of these compaction processes, iSnobal accounts three - 2,3 & 4.
**	This routine addresses 2, temperature metamorphism, and 3., overburden
**	metamorphism. The 4th, addition of liquid water is accounted for in the 
**	routine _h2o_compact.c. We are using equations found in Anderson (1976)
**	and Oleson, et al. (2013), who got his equations from Anderson in the
**	first place.  (Oleson made it easier to figure out the units...)
**
**	Though many dedicated individuals have worked on the density issue over
**	over the last 60+ years, we have, in general, a group working in Saporro
**	Japan to thank for most of what we know about snow density. Anderson
**	got the data and basic fitting equations from careful field and cold
**	room measurements made by Yosida (1963), Mellor (1964) and Kojima (1967).
**	The equations we are using are based on those that they derived from data
**	that they carefully collected over a number of years.  It is noteworthy
**	that while rapidly changing computers have made the kind of spatial
**	modeling we are attempting possible, snow physics remains unchanged â€“ and
**	the field and labortory efforts and data fitting equations from more than
**	half a century ago represent our best understanding of those physics.
**
**	Tz = 0.0 (freezing temperature, C or K)
**	Ts = snow or precipitation temperature (C or K)
**	rho = intital snow density (kg/(m^3))
**	SWE = snow mass (mm/(m^2))
**	K = temperature metamorphism coef.
**	rho_n = new snow density (kg/(m^3))
**	zs = new snow depth (mm)
**
**	Proportional Destructive Temperature Metamorphism (PTM):
**
**	if (rho < 100)
**		K = 1.0
**	else
**		K = exp(-0.046 * (rho - 100))
**	
**	PTM = 0.01 * K * exp(-0.04 * (Tz - Ts))
**
**	Proportional Overburden Compaction (POC):
**
**	POC = (0.026 * exp(-0.08 * (Tz - Ts)) * SWE * exp(-21.0 * rho))
**
**	New snow density and depth
**	
**	rho_n = rho + ((PTM + POC) * rho)
**	zs_n = SWE / rho_n

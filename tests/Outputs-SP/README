The graph.plot is not an IPW image.  Instead, it's the output from the Unix
graph(1) command.  The format of the file is described by the plot(4B) man
page.  The copy of graph.plot here in this directory was generated on an
older version of Solaris (< Solaris 9).  The copy of graph.plot in the
../Outputs/ directory was generated on Solaris 9.  They differ by 4 bytes.
The ./graph.plot file has 4 extra bytes:

Both occurrences of the 2-character sequence "\nt" have been removed in the
../Outputs/graph.plot file.  Perhaps due to a change in the graph(1) command,
but no documentation to that effect could be found.

Although graph.plot is not an IPW image, the pre-Solaris-9 copy of the file
was placed in this directory to allow the grhist test to pass on the few
Solaris 8 machines still used by IPW users.  Since Solaris 8 is in Phase 2 of
its End Of Life (EOL) according to Sun (as of May 29, 2009), this temporary
work-around will eventually become unnecessary and then can be removed.
